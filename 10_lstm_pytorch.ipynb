       "'1/I SELL MY DREAMS\\nShort stories\\nINTRODUCTION\\nA short story is a prose narrative of limited length.\\nIt organises the action and thoughts of its\\ncharacters into the pattern of a plot. The plot\\nform may be comic, tragic, romantic or satiric.\\nThe central incident is selected to manifest, as\\nmuch as possible, the protagonist’s life and\\ncharacter , and the details contribute to the\\ndevelopment of the plot.\\nThe term ‘short story’ covers a great diversity of\\nprose fiction, right from the really short ‘short\\nstory’ of about five hundred words to longer and\\nmore complex works. The longer ones, with their\\nstatus of middle length, fall between the tautness\\nof the short narrative and the expansiveness of\\nthe novel.\\nThere can be thematic variation too. The stories\\ndeal with fantasy, reality, alienation and the\\nproblem of choice in personal life.

During the morning\\nnobody worried about the car encrusted in the wall, for\\npeople assumed it was one of those that had been parked\\non the pavement. But when the crane lifted it out of its\\nsetting, the body of a woman was found secured behind\\nthe steering wheel by a seat belt. The blow had been so\\nbrutal that not a single one of her bones was left whole.\\nHer face was destroyed, her boots had been ripped apart,\\nand her clothes were in shreds. She wore a gold ring shaped\\nlike a serpent, with emerald eyes. The police established\\nthat she was the housekeeper for the new Portuguese\\nambassador and his wife. She had come to Havana with\\nthem two weeks before and had left that morning for the\\nmarket, driving a new car . Her name meant nothing to me\\nwhen I read it in the newspaper , but I was intrigued by the\\nsnake ring and its emerald eyes. I could not find out,\\nhowever, on which finger she wor e it.\\nThis was a crucial piece of information, because I feared\\nshe was an unforgettable woman whose real name I never\\nknew, and who wore a similar ring on her right forefinger\\nwhich, in those days, was even more unusual than it is\\nnow. I had met her thirty-four years earlier in Vienna,\\neating sausage with boiled potatoes and drinking draft beer\\nin a tavern frequented by Latin American students. I had\\ncome from Rome that morning, and I still remember my\\nimmediate response to her splendid soprano’s bosom, the\\nlanguid foxtails on her coat collar , and that Egyptian ring\\nin the shape of a serpent. She spoke an elementary Spanish\\nin a metallic accent without pausing for breath, and I\\nthought she was the only Austrian at the long wooden\\ntable. But no, she had been born in Colombia and had\\ncome to Austria between the wars, when she was little\\nmore than a child, to study music and voice. She was\\nabout thirty, and did not carry her years well, for she had\\nnever been pretty and had begun to age before her time.\\nBut she was a charming human being. And one of the\\nmost awe-inspiring.\\nVienna was still an old imperial city, whose\\ngeographical position between the two irreconcilable worlds\\nleft behind by the Second W orld War had tur ned it into a\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n4/KALEIDOSCOPE\\nparadise of black marketeering and international espionage.\\nI could not have imagined a more suitable spot for my\\nfugitive compatriot, who still ate in the students’ tavern\\non the corner only out of loyalty to her origins, since she\\nhad more than enough money to buy meals for all her\\ntable companions. She never told her real name, and we\\nalways knew her by the Germanic tongue twister that we\\nLatin American students in Vienna invented for her: Frau\\nFrieda. I had just been introduced to her when I committed\\nthe happy impertinence of asking how she had come to be\\nin a world so distant and different from the windy cliffs of\\nQuindio, and she answered with a devastating:\\n‘I sell my dreams.’\\nIn reality, that was her only trade. She had been the\\nthird of eleven children born to a prosperous shopkeeper\\nin old Caldas, and as soon as she learned to speak she\\ninstituted the fine custom in her family of telling dreams\\nbefore breakfast, the time when their oracular qualities\\nare preserved in their purest form. When she was seven\\nshe dreamed that one of her brothers was carried off by a\\nflood. Her mother , out of sheer r eligious superstition,\\nforbade the boy to swim in the ravine, which was his\\nfavourite pastime. But Frau Frieda already had her own\\nsystem of prophecy.\\n‘What that dream means,’ she said, ‘isn’t that he’s\\ngoing to drown, but that he shouldn’t eat sweets.’\\nHer interpretation seemed an infamy to a five-year -old\\nboy who could not live without his Sunday treats. Their\\nmother , convinced of her daughter’s oracular talents,\\nenforced the warning with an iron hand. But in her first\\ncareless moment the boy choked on a piece of caramel that\\nhe was eating in secret, and there was no way to save him.\\nFrau Frieda did not think she could earn a living with\\nher talent until life caught her by the throat during the\\ncruel Viennese winters. Then she looked for work at the\\nfirst house where she would have liked to live, and when\\nshe was asked what she could do, she told only the truth:\\n‘I dream.’ A brief explanation to the lady of the house was\\nall she needed, and she was hired at a salary that just\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n5/I SELL MY DREAMS\\ncovered her minor expenses, but she had a nice room and\\nthree meals a day—br eakfast in particular, when the family\\nsat down to learn the immediate future of each of its\\nmembers: the father , a r efined financier; the mother , a\\njoyful woman passionate about Romantic chamber music;\\nand two children, eleven and nine years old. They were all\\nreligious and therefore inclined to archaic superstitions,\\nand they were delighted to take in Frau Frieda, whose\\nonly obligation was to decipher the family’s daily fate\\nthrough her dreams.\\nShe did her job well, and for a long time, above all\\nduring the war years, when reality was more sinister than\\nnightmares. Only she could decide at breakfast what each\\nshould do that day, and how it should be done, until her\\npredictions became the sole authority in the house. Her\\ncontrol over the family was absolute: even the faintest sigh\\nwas br eathed by her or der. The master of the house died\\nat about the time I was in Vienna, and had the elegance to\\nleave her a part of his estate on the condition that she\\ncontinue dreaming for the family until her dreams came\\nto an end.\\nI stayed in Vienna for more than a month, sharing the\\nstraitened circumstances of the other students while I\\nwaited for money that never arrived. Frau Frieda’s\\nunexpected and generous visits to the tavern were like\\nfiestas in our poverty-stricken regime. One night, in a beery\\neuphoria, she whispered in my ear with a conviction that\\npermitted no delay.\\n‘I only came to tell you that I dreamed about you last\\nnight,’ she said. ‘You must leave right away and not come\\nback to Vienna for five years.’\\nHer conviction was so real that I boarded the last train\\nto Rome that same night. As for me, I was so influenced by\\nwhat she said that from then on I considered myself a\\nsurvivor of some catastrophe I never experienced. I still\\nhave not returned to Vienna.\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n6/KALEIDOSCOPE\\nStop and ThinkStop and ThinkStop and ThinkStop and ThinkStop and Think\\n1. How did the author recognise the lady who was\\nextricated from the car encrusted in the wall of Havana\\nRiviera Hotel after the storm?\\n2. Why did the author leave Vienna never to return\\nagain?\\nBefore the disaster in Havana, I had seen Frau Frieda\\nin Barcelona in so unexpected and fortuitous a way that it\\nseemed a mystery to me. It happened on the day Pablo\\nNeruda stepped on Spanish soil for the first time since the\\nCivil W ar, on a stopover during a long sea voyage to\\nValparaiso. He spent a mor ning with us hunting big game\\nin the second-hand bookstores, and at Porter he bought\\nan old, dried-out volume with a torn binding for which he\\npaid what would have been his salary for two months at\\nthe consulate in Rangoon. He moved through the crowd\\nlike an invalid elephant, with a child’s curiosity in the\\ninner workings of each thing he saw, for the world appeared\\nto him as an immense wind-up toy with which life invented\\nitself.\\nI have never known anyone closer to the idea one has\\nof a Renaissance pope: He was gluttonous and refined.\\nEven against his will, he always presided at the table.\\nMatilde, his wife, would put a bib around his neck that\\nbelonged in a barbershop rather than a dining room, but it\\nwas the only way to keep him from taking a bath in sauce.\\nThat day at Carvalleiras was typical. He ate three whole\\nlobsters, dissecting them with a surgeon’s skill, and at the\\nsame time devoured everyone else’s plate with his eyes\\nand tasted a little from each with a delight that made the\\ndesire to eat contagious: clams from Galicia, mussels from\\nCantabria, prawns from Alicante, sea cucumbers from the\\nCosta Brava. In the meantime, like the French, he spoke\\nof nothing but other culinary delicacies, in particular the\\nprehistoric shellfish of Chile, which he carried in his heart.\\nAll at once he stopped eating, tuned his lobster’s antennae,\\nand said to me in a very quiet voice:\\n‘There’s someone behind me who won’t stop looking at\\nme.’\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n7/I SELL MY DREAMS\\nI glanced over his shoulder , and it was true. Thr ee\\ntables away sat an intrepid woman in an old-fashioned\\nfelt hat and a purple scarf, eating without haste and staring\\nat him. I recognised her right away. She had grown old\\nand fat, but it was Frau Frieda, with the snake ring on her\\nindex finger .\\nShe was travelling from Naples on the same ship as\\nNeruda and his wife, but they had not seen each other on\\nboard. We invited her to have cof fee at our table, and I\\nencouraged her to talk about her dreams in order to astound\\nthe poet. He paid no attention, for from the very beginning\\nhe had announced that he did not believe in prophetic\\ndreams.\\n‘Only poetry is clairvoyant,’ he said.\\nAfter lunch, during the inevitable stroll along the\\nRamblas, I lagged behind with Frau Frieda so that we could\\nrenew our memories with no other ears listening. She told\\nme she had sold her properties in Austria and retired to\\nOporto, in Portugal, where she lived in a house that she\\ndescribed as a fake castle on a hill, from which one could\\nsee all the way across the ocean to the Americas. Although\\nshe did not say so, her conversation made it clear that,\\ndream by dream, she had taken over the entire fortune of\\nher ineffable patrons in Vienna. That did not surprise me,\\nhowever, because I had always thought her dr eams wer e\\nno more than a stratagem for surviving. And I told her so.\\nShe laughed her irr esistible laugh. ‘You’re as impudent\\nas ever,’ she said. And said no mor e, because the r est of\\nthe group had stopped to wait for Neruda to finish talking\\nin Chilean slang to the parrots along the Rambla de los\\nPájaros. When we resumed our conversation, Frau Frieda\\nchanged the subject.\\n‘By the way,’ she said, ‘you can go back to Vienna\\nnow.’\\nOnly then did I realise that thirteen years had gone by\\nsince our first meeting.\\n‘Even if your dreams are false, I’ll never go back,’ I told\\nher. ‘Just in case.’\\nAt three o’clock we left her to accompany Neruda to his\\nsacred siesta, which he took in our house after solemn\\nReprint 2025-26\\n\\n8/KALEIDOSCOPE\\npreparations that in some way recalled the Japanese tea\\nceremony. Some windows had to be opened and others closed\\nto achieve the perfect degree of warmth, and there had to\\nbe a certain kind of light from a certain direction, and\\nabsolute silence. Neruda fell asleep right away, and woke\\nten minutes later , as childr en do, when we least expected\\nit. He appeared in the living room refreshed, and with the\\nmonogram of the pillowcase imprinted on his cheek.\\n‘I dreamed about that woman who dreams,’ he said.\\nMatilde wanted him to tell her his dream.\\n‘I dreamed she was dreaming about me,’ he said.\\n‘That’s right out of Borges,’ I said.\\nHe looked at me in disappointment.\\n‘Has he written it already?’\\n‘If he hasn’t he’ll write it sometime,’ I said. ‘It will be\\none of his labyrinths.’\\nAs soon as he boarded the ship at six that evening, Neruda\\ntook his leave of us, sat down at an isolated table, and began\\nto write fluid verses in the green ink he used for drawing\\nflowers and fish and birds when he dedicated his books. At\\nthe first ‘All ashore’ we looked for Frau Frieda, and found her\\nat last on the tourist deck, just as we were about to leave\\nwithout saying good-bye. She too had taken a siesta.\\n‘I dreamed about the poet,’ she said.\\nIn astonishment I asked her to tell me her dream.\\n‘I dreamed he was dreaming about me,’ she said, and\\nmy look of amazement disconcerted her . ‘What did you\\nexpect?
